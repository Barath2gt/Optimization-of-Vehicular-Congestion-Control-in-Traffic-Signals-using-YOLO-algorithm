# Optimization-of-Vehicular-Congestion-Control-in-Traffic-Signals-using-YOLO-algorithm
## Proposed Methodology!
Vehicle Detection module is responsible for detecting the number of vehicles in the image received as input from the camera. More specifically, it will provide as output the number of vehicles of each vehicle class such as car, bike, bus, truck, and rickshaw.
Signal Switching Algorithm updates the red, green, and yellow times of all signals.  These timers are set bases on the count of vehicles of each class received from the vehicle detection module and several other factors such as the number of lanes, average speed of each class of vehicle, etc.
The Simulation Module aims to provide a visual representation of the traffic signals and vehicles moving through an intersection. It uses the Pygame library to create an interactive simulation.
